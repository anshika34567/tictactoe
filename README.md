 Tic Tac Toe Game

A modern and interactive **Tic Tac Toe web application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. The game allows users to play in **two-player mode** or **single-player mode against an AI opponent** with selectable difficulty levels.


 📌 Project Description

This project recreates the classic Tic Tac Toe game with a clean and responsive user interface. The game uses a 3×3 grid where players take turns placing **X** and **O**. It automatically checks for winning conditions and declares the result. Winning cells are highlighted for better visual feedback, and if no player wins, the game ends in a draw.

In **single-player mode**, the computer acts as an AI opponent with:
- **Easy mode** – random moves  
- **Medium mode** – intelligent moves (win, block, center, corners)

The game is fully responsive, keyboard-accessible, and can be reset anytime using the reset button.
